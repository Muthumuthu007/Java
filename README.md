# Java Practice Programs

Welcome to my Java practice repository! This repository contains various Java programs that I have written over the past three months to improve my Java programming skills.

## Overview

This repository is a collection of Java programs covering various topics and concepts, including basic syntax, data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Muthumuthu007/Java.git
Navigate to the project directory:
 cd Java

Usage
Navigate to the directory of the program you want to run and use the following commands:
    javac ProgramName.java
     java ProgramName
Replace ProgramName with the actual name of the Java file you want to run.

Programs Included

Basic Syntax: HelloWorld.java, VariablesAndDataTypes.java
Control Structures: IfElseDemo.java, LoopsDemo.java
OOP: ClassesAndObjects.java, InheritanceDemo.java
Data Structures: ArraysDemo.java, LinkedListDemo.java
Algorithms: SortingAlgorithms.java, SearchAlgorithms.java
